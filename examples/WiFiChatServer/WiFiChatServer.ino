  WiFiChatServer.ino

  A simple server that distributes any incoming messages to all
  connected clients.  To use telnet to  your device's IP address and type.
  You can see the client's input in the serial monitor as well.

  This example is written for a network using WPA encryption. For
  WEP or WPA, change the Wifi.begin() call accordingly.

  Circuit:
   Board with NINA module (Arduino MKR WiFi 1010, MKR VIDOR 4000 and UNO WiFi Rev.2)

  Based on and modified from WiFiNINA library https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiNINA
  to support nRF52, SAMD21/SAMD51, STM32F/L/H/G/WB/MP1, Teensy, etc. boards besides Nano-33 IoT, MKRWIFI1010, MKRVIDOR400, etc.
