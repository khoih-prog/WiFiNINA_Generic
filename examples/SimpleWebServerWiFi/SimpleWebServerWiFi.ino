  WiFi Web Server LED Blink

  A simple web server that lets you blink an LED via the web.
  This sketch will print the IP address of your WiFi module (once connected)
  to the Serial monitor. From there, you can open that address in a web browser
  to turn on and off the LED on pin 9.

  If the IP address of your board is yourAddress:
  http://yourAddress/H turns the LED on
  http://yourAddress/L turns it off

  This example is written for a network using WPA encryption. For
  WEP or WPA, change the Wifi.begin() call accordingly.

  Circuit:
   Board with NINA module (Arduino MKR WiFi 1010, MKR VIDOR 4000 and UNO WiFi Rev.2)
   LED attached to pin 9

  created 25 Nov 2012
  by Tom Igoe

  Based on and modified from WiFiNINA libarary https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiNINA
  to support other boards besides Nano-33 IoT, MKRWIFI1010, MKRVIDOR4000, etc.
